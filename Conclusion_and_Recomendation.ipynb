The lack of score can be explain as lack of features, can be in form of indicators used, bad timeframe, knowledge limitation, and lack of external information. We used only 8 indicators for this project as our feature and able to achieve a 68% precision. Given more time, knowledge, and resource this project shows promise in future endeavor."
